**C++ Definitions, Syntax and Concepts**

C++ is a programming language that is a superset of C wherein additional features are made in the C language. 
Namespace is used to resolving the name conflict of the identifier which is accomploshed by placing them under various namespaces, which helps
in the logical division of the different codes.

**Object Oriented Programming:**
  Class is referred to as the designing of the user-defined data type. 
  It reflects the different entities, attributes and actions.
  
  **Access Specifiers:**
  Public: members can be accessed throughout the entire program
  Private: members that can't be accessed outside the class 
  Protected: members can only be accessed inside its class OR through inheritance 
  
  **Object:**
  An instance of the class. It can have fields, methods, constructors and related. 
  For example, a bike is an object but it has various features such as brakes, color, size and design which are instances of the class.
    
 **Encapsulation:** 
  Process of binding together the data and functions in a class. It is applied to prevent direct access to the data for security reasons. 
  Sensistive information are hidden from the user and are only accessible through getter and setter functions.
    
 **Abstraction:** 
 Hiding background details/implementations and displaying only the essential details. 
 Data members and member functions are grouped using access specifiers.

**Inheritance:**
When classes are allowed to access the properties of another class

**Polymorphism:**
